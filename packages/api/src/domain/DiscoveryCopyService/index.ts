/**
 * Turns a library recipe into one of the caller's own recipes. The copy goes through `RecipeService.createRecipe`, so
 * ownership, tagging and `users` scoping are exactly those of any recipe the user creates; the library document is only
 * read. The copy keeps the source page as `link` and the licence `attribution`, which CC BY-SA requires.
 *
 * The library's `coverImageKey` is never referenced: a key owned by the library stops being served the moment the
 * recipe is unpublished or delisted. The cover is copied to the user's own key instead, so the copy keeps its picture.
